Related terms: word class, lexical class, and lexical category
Some authors restrict the term lexical category to refer only to a particular
type of syntactic category and in doing so the term excludes those parts
of speech that are considered to be functional, such as pronouns.
Word classes may be classified as open or closed where:
  open classes (such as nouns, verbs and adjectives) acquire new members constantly.
  closed classes (such as pronouns and conjunctions) rarely acquire new members, if ever.
